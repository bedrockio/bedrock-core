# Passkey Authentication

This API provides the challenge/response flows allowing the use of passkeys. It
is set up to provide "seamless" authentication, meaning no information
(username/email) is required to authenticate the user. Responses are designed
specifically to work with [SimpleWebAuthn](https://simplewebauthn.dev/).

Passkeys will **not** be met with MFA challenges as they are inherently more
secure.

## Generate Login

Gets options to be passed to the client to authorize a passkey in a login flow.
The resulting `token` should be passed back into `verify-login`.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/passkey/generate-login" />

## Verify Login

Verifies client response to authorize a new passkey in a login flow.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/passkey/verify-login" />

## Generate New Passkey

Gets options to be passed to the client to create a new passkey. The resulting
`token` should be passed back into `verify-new`.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/passkey/generate-new" />

## Verify New Passkey

Verifies client response and stores a new passkey.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/passkey/verify-new" />

## Disable

Deletes a passkey. Note that passkeys on the client side must be removed by the
user.

<Route route="DELETE /1/auth/passkey/:id" />
