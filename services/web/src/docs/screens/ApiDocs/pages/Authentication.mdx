This API can be used for signing up new users, obtaining tokens and performing
user self-administration such as resetting of password.

## Register

Creates a new user object in the system. This can be initiated without any
authentication.

<RequestBlock request={{ method: 'POST', path: '/1/auth/register' }} />

_Note: If you want to update other attributes on a User, please see the
`PATCH /1/users/me` API call_

## Login

This exchanges a user's credentials (email and password) for a JWT token. This
token can be used for authentication on all subsequent API calls (See Getting
Started). Unless the user has mfa enabled.

<RequestBlock request={{ method: 'POST', path: '/1/auth/login' }} />

Note if the user has mfa enabled the mfaToken is required for POST /1/mfa/verify

## Logout

This deauthenticates all tokens for the given user

<RequestBlock request={{ method: 'POST', path: '/1/auth/logout' }} />

## Request Password

This call can be used for the user to reset their password. A temporary token
and link will be mailed to the user's email address if found in the system.

<RequestBlock request={{ method: 'POST', path: '/1/auth/request-password' }} />

## Set Password

This call can be used to use a temporary token (obtained via request-password)
to set a new password.

<RequestBlock request={{ method: 'POST', path: '/1/auth/set-password' }} />
