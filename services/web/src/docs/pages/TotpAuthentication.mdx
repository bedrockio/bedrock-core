# TOTP Authentication API

A TOTP or "Timed OTP" is a code generated by an authenticator app. This API is
used to validate those codes as well as set up a new TOTP authenticator.

## Login

Verifies a TOTP in an MFA flow. This route will also ensure that the password
was recently verified and throw an error if not.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/totp/login" />

## Request

Generates a new TOTP to be presented to the user as part of the enable TOTP
flow.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/totp/request" />

## Enable

Validates a TOTP code and enables the TOTP as one of the user's authenticators.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/totp/enable" />

## Disable

Removes registered TOTP authenticator.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/totp/disable" />
