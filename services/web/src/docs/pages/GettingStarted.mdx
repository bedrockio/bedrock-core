# Getting Started

Our API follows a RESTful JSON structure and provides options for exporting CSV
through specific endpoints. Communication is securely enforced over HTTPS, with
support for TLS 1.3 encryption, and CloudFlare provides additional protection.
API credentials can be managed with a full RBAC permissioning layer.

### URL

Main production URL:

<Code>{`${API_URL}/`}</Code>

### API Key

Each client using using the api must provide use an API key to identify itself.
You can provide your API key via an header (`API-Key: <apiKey>`):

<Code language="bash">{`curl -H 'API-Key: <apiKey>' ${API_URL}/`}</Code>

### Authentication

JWT is used for all authentication. You can provide your API token in a standard
bearer token request (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`) like so:

<Code language="bash">
  {`curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' ${API_URL}/`}
</Code>

_When receiving a 401 status code, the client should clear any stored JWT
tokens - this will enable authentication reset and expiry behavior_

### Requests

A pragmatic RESTful style is enforced on all API calls. GET requests are only
used to obtain objects.

Search/List API calls are done using POST to allow reliable JSON parameters.
Example search:

<Code language="bash">
  {`curl \\
  -X POST ${API_URL}/1/users/search \\
  -d '{"limit": 100, "skip": 0}' \\
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\
  -H 'APIKey: <apikey>' \\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'`}
</Code>

### Responses

A standard successful response envelope has a `data` attribute containing the
result. An optional `meta` response can be given to provide supplementary
information such as pagination information:

```json
{
  "data": [{}],
  "meta": {
    "total": 45367,
    "skip": 0,
    "limit": 100
  }
}
```

Mutation operations (PATCH and DELETE) may contain a `success` boolean in the
response.

### Errors

Errors are returned as follows:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "\"userId\" needs to be a valid ID"
  }
}
```

An additional `details` array is added for validation errors to specify which
fields had errors:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "\"userId\" needs to be a valid ID",
    "details": [
      {
        "message": "\"userId\" needs to be a valid ID",
        "path": ["userId"],
        "type": "string.invalidID",
        "context": {
          "value": "INVALID",
          "key": "userId",
          "label": "userId"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
