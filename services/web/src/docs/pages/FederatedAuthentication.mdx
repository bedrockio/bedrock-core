# Federated Authentication

Works with OAuth2 federated providers, currently
[Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in) and
[Apple](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/about-sign-in-with-apple/).

Note that federated authentication may result in a signup when authenticating
for the first time. If additional required fields are added to the user model
then this will fail as only `email`, `firstName`, and `lastName` are provided.
In this case your options are:

1. Make additional fields optional and instead use client side logic to redirect
   to an onboarding flow.
2. Remove signup buttons from the registration page and only allow login. Note
   that login attempts will be met with an error if the provided `email` does
   not exist.

Note that federated flows are not met with an MFA challenge.

Note that Google and Apple flows are nearly identical with the exception that
the Google API accepts a `code` that will be exchanged for a token, where the
Apple API accepts a `token` directly.
