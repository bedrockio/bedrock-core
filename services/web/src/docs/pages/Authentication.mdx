## Signup

Note that new user registration often has special requirements and is separate
from this API, however signup allows for an OTP challenge to be validated
[here](/docs/authentication/otp#login).

## Logout

This deauthenticates all tokens for the given user

<Route route="POST /1/auth/logout" />

## MFA Method

Updates the MFA method for the user. Note that the methods `sms` or `email` are
handled by [OTP](/docs/otp) routes and `totp` is handled by [TOTP](/docs/totp).

<Route route="PATCH /1/auth/mfa-method" />
