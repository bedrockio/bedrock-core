# OTP Authentication

An OTP may be either a code or a link sent to the user.

## Send

Creates and assigns a new OTP code for the user and sends out an SMS or email.
Either an email or phone number must be provided.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/otp/send" />

## Login

Verifies the sent code and authenticates the user. This will **not** be met with
an MFA challenge.

In addition to validating codes sent with [send](#send), this route verifies
codes in an MFA flow in two scenarios:

1. The user requests a passwordless signup by either `code` or `link`.
2. The user has an MFA of `email` or `sms` set and is met with an MFA challenge
   when attempting to authenticate with a password.

When in this flow and a password has been set, an error will be thrown if the
password has not been recently verified (5 minutes).

Authenticating with an OTP will also set the email or phone verified status.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/otp/login" />
