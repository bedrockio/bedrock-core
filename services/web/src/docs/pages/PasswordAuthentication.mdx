# Password Authentication

This API performs login and password self-administration such as resetting of
password.

## Login

This exchanges a user's credentials (email and password) for a JWT token. This
token can be used for authentication on all subsequent API calls (See
[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started)). Password login may be met with an MFA
challenge if set by the user.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/password/login" />

## Request Password

This call can be used for the user to reset their password. A temporary token
and link will be mailed to the user's email address if found in the system.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/password/request" />

## Set Password

Sets a new password for the user.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/password/update" />
